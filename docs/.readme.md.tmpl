matching, templating and scripting capabilities that increases your
productivity.

## Installation

### Pre-built binaries

Download the appropriate binary from the [latest
release](https://github.com/{{$repository}}/releases/latest) and install it
where you see fit.

_Note: the macOS binaries are not signed yet, you will have to open them through the GUI first._

### Via the Go toolchain

```
go install github.com/aymericbeaumet/pimp@latest
```

## Usage

### Pimpfile

Pimpfile are an important part of pimp. These YAML files allow you to configure
command expansion and tasks with a simple and expressive syntax.

Read more about [Pimpfiles](./docs/pimpfile.md) in the documentation.

### Command Expander

When pimp is used as a command expander, it's going to try to match the command
and args it is being given with the patterns you have defined in your
`~/.Pimpfile`.

For example in this case, when `git` is passed (with no extra arguments), it is
going to be expanded into `git status -sb`. If some arguments are passed, then
it is going to be expanded to `git <args>`.

```
$ cat ~/.Pimpfile
git: git status -sb
git ...: git
```

```
$ pimp git # equivalent to `git status -sb`
$ pimp git log # equivalent to `git log`
```

Read more about [command expansion](./docs/command-expander.md) in the documentation.

### Task Runner

Following the same concept as command expansion (see above), you can also
leverage pimp to behave as a task runner for your project. The Pimpfile in your
local directory always has the highest priority.

For example this is how you would do if you wanted to define a

```
$ cat ./Pimpfile
test: go test ./...
$ pimp test
```

Read more about [running tasks](./docs/task-runner.md) in the documentation.

### Template Engine

```
$ pimp --render template.tmpl
```

Read more about how to use pimp as a stand-alone [template
engine](./docs/template-engine.md) in the documentation.

### Script Engine (PimpScript)

```
$ pimp --run script.pimp
```

Read more about how to use pimp as a [script engine](./docs/script-engine.md) in the documentation.

### Go Library

## Documentation

The [documentation](./docs) contains information regarding how you can get the
most out of pimp.

## Examples

The [examples](./examples) are available as references to help you start using
pimp.
