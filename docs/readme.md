Welcome to pimp's documentation.

pimp is a shell-agnostic [command expander](user-guide/command-expander.md) and [task runner](user-guide/task-runner.md) with pattern matching, [templating](user-guide/template-engine/), and [scripting](user-guide/script-engine.md) capabilities that increases your productivity.

pimp offers a rich ecosystem of [template functions](user-guide/template-engine/functions.md) that can be used in a wide variety of contexts \(CLI, templates, Go code, etc\).

You should first start by making sure you have [installed pimp properly](installation.md). Once that's done you can follow the [Getting Started](getting-started/welcome.md). Once you have completed it, the [User Guide](user-guide/pimpfile.md) will hopefully prove useful to give you deeper knowledge.
